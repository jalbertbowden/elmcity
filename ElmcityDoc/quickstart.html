I've posted the first version of the <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/elmcity-project-faq/">FAQ</a> for the elmcity calendar syndication project. If you're interested in becoming a calendar curator for your community, or if you know someone else who would be, that's the place to start.
</p>
<p>
If you're impatient, like me, here's the quickstart. Suppose your community is Ypsilanti, Michigan. The steps are as follows.
</p>
<h2>
1. Create a Delicious account. For example: ypsicals.
</h2>
<h2>
2. Bookmark this URL:
</h2>
<p>
http://delicious.com/ypsicals/metadata
</p>
<p>
To do that, start here:
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://jonudell.net/elmcity/elmcity_quickstart_01.png">
</p>
<p>
Then do this:
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://jonudell.net/elmcity/elmcity_quickstart_02.png">
</p>
<h2>
3. Add these tags to the bookmark:
</h2>
<p>where=ypsilanti,mi</p>
<p>tz=eastern</p> (See the <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/elmcity-project-faq/">FAQ</a> for the full list of timezone names.)
</p>
<p>
Like so:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
There's more, of course, but that's the minimal setup required to bootstrap a location and have it show up in the <a href="http://elmcity.cloudapp.net">aggregator</a>.
