<h1>Curator tutorials</h1>


<h2>Eleanor Wilson Museum</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://jonudell.net/elmcity/eleanor-wilson-museum.html">Eleanor Wilson Museum</a> tutorial shows how to trace an event from a newspaper listing to its authoritative source website, check that website for a calendar page, check the calendar page for an iCal feed, and if one exists (as in this example it does) capture the iCal URL for use in a syndication hub.
</p>

<h2>Sapphire Dance</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://jonudell.net/elmcity/sapphire-dance-example.html">Sapphire Dance</a> tutorial again begins with an event in a newspaper listing, and traces back to an authoritative source with an iCal feed. In this case, the source uses Google Calendar to provide several feeds. The tutorial shows how to discover the URLs of those feeds, differentiate them, and add them to a hub with appropriate tags.
</p>

<h2>Bootstrapping FloydVA</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://jonudell.net/elmcity/bootstrapping-floydva.html">Bootstrapping Floyd</a> example shows how to process the feeds automatically discovered by the elmcity service when a new hub is first started.
</p>

<h2>Christiansburg VA is not in the Caribbean</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://jonudell.net/elmcity/christiansburg-not-caribbean.html">Christiansburg is not in the Caribbean</a> example shows that non-authoritative sources can make, then amplify, errors. In this case Eventful confuses Christiansted, St. Croix, VI (Virgin Islands), a venue its robot found on ReverbNation, with Christiansburg VA.
</p>

<h2>Christiansburg.org</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://jonudell.net/elmcity/christiansburg-dot-org.html">Christiansburg.org</a> example shows again how non-authoritative sources can make, then amplify, errors. In this case Eventful correctly finds a kids' gymnastics event in August, but incorrectly locates it at the Recreation Center. 
</p>

<h2>Adaire Theatre</h2>

<p>
The <a href="http://jonudell.net/elmcity/adaire-theatre.html">Adaire Theater on EventBrite</a> example shows how to process an EventBrite venue found by the auto-discovery process.
</p>



<h2>NRV dark datter</h2>
<p>
<p>
The <a href="http://jonudell.net/elmcity/nrv-dark-matter.html">NRV dark matter</a> example lists sites, discovered while processing the auto-discovered feeds for the NewRiverValleyVA hubs, with online calendars that should be, but aren't, machine-readable. These represent "dark matter" that wants to be lit up. 
</p>

<h2>NRV bright lights</h2>
<p>
<p>
The <a href="http://jonudell.net/elmcity/nrv-bright-lights.html">NRV bright lights</a> example lists sites with online calendars that <i>are</i> machine-readable. These are community role models.
