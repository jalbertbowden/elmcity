<p>
While processing the auto-discovered feeds for the NewRiverValleyVA hubs I kept track of sites with calendar pages that should be, but aren't, machine-readable. These represent "dark matter" that wants to be lit up. How? For starters, try notifying these sites that by using standard calendar software to publish calendars to their own sites they could also create calendars that syndicate. Doesn't hurt to ask!
